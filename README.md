# EE209CR_Fall19
This repository contains projects for EE 209 Computational Robotics and is maintained by four UCLA ECE students: Tiantong Wang, Yuxuan Chen, Tianyuan Chen and Jiangyi Yao. 

The first project (lab 1) is intended to generate trajectories for a robot to reach a certain location (reward), with the Markov Decision Process. Codes can be run and editted via the Jupyter notebook platform. “MDPandPlanning.ipynb” is intended for part 1 and 2 for lab 1. Test programs are included. "PolicyIteration.ipynb" and "ValueIteration.ipynb" are intended for part 3 and 4, respectively. They can be run by themselves (since they include codes that realize same functions defined in part 1 and 2). Graphical representation of the end results will be displayed.
